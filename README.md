# Template bot

This is a bot that you can take as an example;
it has a `/ban` command which accepts a User, a timeframe of messages to be deleted and a reason for the ban.
This also contains a text command `exit` to shut down the bot.

You can follow [the wiki][wiki-instructions-url] for instructions on how to use it.
